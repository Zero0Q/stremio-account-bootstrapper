# Stremio Account Bootstrapper

Stremio Account Bootstrapper lets you set up your Stremio account with just a few clicks by bootstrapping a preset into your account. It's handy for newcomers, those who want a solid foundation to build their setup on, or to speed up the process of setting up new accounts for family members or friends.

**WARNING: You will wipe the existing setup and there's no current way to restore the previous configuration. Use it at your own risk. No support is provided.**

## Features

- Automated process of setting up an account in a couple of minutes.
- Option to set the preset to different languages. English (US) and Spanish (MX) are currently supported.
- Better multilanguage support in Stremio.
- TMDB is the default metadata resolver. Cinemeta catalogs were removed without breaking any core functionality.
- RealDebrid and AllDebrid support.
- Ability to reset the account to a default state.
- Optimized addons configuration.
- Sort addons and rename/delete catalogs (inherited from Addons Manager).
